# Requirements Archive: v0.1 Core Installer

**Archived:** 2026-02-24
**Milestone:** v0.1 Core Installer (Phases 1–2)
**Core Value:** The fastest way to extend Claude Code with reusable, community-contributed components — one command, files in the right place.

> This is the requirements snapshot at v0.1 completion. Requirements for the next milestone are defined fresh via `/gsd:new-milestone`.

## v1 Requirements — v0.1 Status

### Installation — Core Flags

- [x] **INST-01**: User can install a skill via `npx cc-templates --skill <name>` — downloads directory to `.claude/skills/<name>/` | **✓ Validated v0.1** — skill.js implements recursive GitHub Contents API download
- [x] **INST-02**: User can install an agent via `npx cc-templates --agent <name>` — downloads `.md` file to `.claude/agents/<name>.md` | **✓ Validated v0.1** — agent.js implements single-file raw fetch
- [x] **INST-03**: User can install a command via `npx cc-templates --command <name>` — downloads `.md` file to `.claude/commands/<name>.md` | **✓ Validated v0.1** — command.js implements single-file raw fetch
- [x] **INST-04**: User can install a hook via `npx cc-templates --hook <name>` — fetches hook JSON and deep-merges into target `settings.json` | **✓ Validated v0.1** — hook.js array-append merge with atomic write
- [x] **INST-05**: User can install to user-global `~/.claude/` instead of project-local `.claude/` via `--global` flag | **✓ Validated v0.1** — opts.global uses homedir() as base in all installers
- [x] **INST-06**: User can force reinstall of an already-installed component via `--overwrite` / `--force` flag | **✓ Validated v0.1** — all installers accept opts.force, warn before overwriting
- [x] **INST-07**: User can point the CLI at a forked GitHub repo via `CC_TEMPLATES_REPO` environment variable | **✓ Validated v0.1** — fetch.js reads CC_TEMPLATES_REPO env override

### Installation — Component Library

- [x] **COMP-01**: `video-download` skill is available to install | **✓ Validated v0.1** — in catalog; installer ready (pending GitHub repo publish)
- [x] **COMP-02**: `video-fetch-and-summarize` skill is available to install | **✓ Validated v0.1** — in catalog; installer ready (pending GitHub repo publish)
- [x] **COMP-03**: `video-summarizer` skill is available to install | **✓ Validated v0.1** — in catalog; installer ready (pending GitHub repo publish)
- [x] **COMP-04**: All component files include YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and optional `author` fields | **✓ Validated v0.1** — validated by build-catalog.js at catalog generation time
- [x] **COMP-05**: Pre-generated `components.json` catalog is shipped inside the npm package for offline/instant listing | **✓ Validated v0.1** — components.json in npm files field, generated from YAML frontmatter

### Safety & UX

- [x] **SAFE-01**: User sees a clear error message when a requested component does not exist, with a list of available components of that type shown inline | **✓ Validated v0.1** — catalog.js validateName() throws with inline list; fires before any network call
- [x] **SAFE-02**: User is warned (and install is aborted) when target file/directory already exists, unless `--force` is passed | **✓ Validated v0.1** — all installers check existsSync before write
- [ ] **SAFE-03**: User can preview what would be installed without any files being written via `--dry-run` flag | **Deferred → Phase 4** — not in v0.1 scope
- [x] **SAFE-04**: User can run the CLI non-interactively in CI pipelines via `--yes` flag (skips all confirmation prompts) | **✓ Validated v0.1** — --yes flag accepted and passed through opts; no interactive prompts in Phase 2
- [ ] **SAFE-05**: User sees a non-blocking warning at startup when running a stale npx-cached version | **Deferred → Phase 4** — not in v0.1 scope
- [x] **SAFE-06**: Hooks installer deep-merges new hook entries into existing `settings.json` without overwriting or removing any existing keys (atomic write via temp file + rename) | **✓ Validated v0.1** — array-append merge + write-file-atomic; malformed JSON aborts cleanly
- [x] **SAFE-07**: Hook command strings containing `python3` are automatically replaced with `python` on Windows | **✓ Validated v0.1** — \bpython3\b regex replacement on win32 platform

### Discovery

- [ ] **DISC-01**: User sees an interactive two-level component picker when running `npx cc-templates` with no flags | **Deferred → Phase 3** — no-flags currently shows --help
- [ ] **DISC-02**: User can list all available components with descriptions and authors via `--list` flag | **Deferred → Phase 3** — --list flag stub in place
- [ ] **DISC-03**: User sees the component `author` field displayed on successful install | **Deferred → Phase 3** — author not yet displayed

## v2 Requirements (Unchanged)

### Extended Installation

- **INST-v2-01**: User can install multiple components in a single invocation (comma-separated values or multiple flags)
- **INST-v2-02**: User can update installed components to latest version via `--update` flag

### Discovery

- **DISC-v2-01**: Fuzzy search in interactive menu
- **DISC-v2-02**: Component categories/tags for filtering in `--list` output

### Extended Library

- **COMP-v2-01**: Agent components in the library
- **COMP-v2-02**: Hook components in the library
- **COMP-v2-03**: Command components in the library
