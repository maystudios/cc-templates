# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** The fastest way to extend Claude Code with reusable, community-contributed components — one command, files in the right place.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone (v1.0 MVP — Phase 3 Discovery UX + Phase 4 Polish+Publish)

## Current Position

Phase: v0.1 milestone complete — ready to plan v1.0
Status: v0.1 SHIPPED — Phases 1+2 archived; next milestone v1.0 (Phases 3+4) not yet started
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — v0.1 milestone archived; ROADMAP.md reorganized; PROJECT.md evolved

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 12 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-scaffold | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |
| 02-core-installer | 5 | 10 min | 2 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (updated after v0.1 milestone).

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `anthropics-community/cc-templates` GitHub repo not yet created — skill end-to-end install not verifiable until published
- `settings.json` hooks schema: MEDIUM confidence — no blocking issues found in Phase 2 implementation
