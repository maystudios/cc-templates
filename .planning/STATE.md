## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Register `cc-templates` npm name before any public announcement — name squatting is non-recoverable
- [Pre-phase]: Use CommonJS (no build step); pin chalk@4.1.2 and ora@7.x to avoid ESM/CJS friction
- [Pre-phase]: Ship pre-generated `components.json` inside npm package for instant offline listing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: `settings.json` hooks schema is MEDIUM confidence — verify against official Anthropic docs before writing hooks merge logic in Phase 2
- [Research]: Verify `cc-templates` npm name is still available and register it as first action of Phase 1
